### Summary

At Intel, I built a career at the intersection of **security, compliance, and innovation**—translating complex policies and technologies into practical, scalable systems that empowered engineers and researchers to move faster with confidence. I’ve led initiatives spanning secure development, open-source governance, Responsible AI, and modernization of legacy toolchains—earning a reputation as a trusted bridge between **Legal, Executive, and Engineering teams**. Whether driving a full compliance process redesign, architecting cross-platform SDKs, or mentoring teams through high-stakes product releases, I combine technical depth with organizational empathy to turn complexity into clarity and execution.

### Key Achievements

- **Transformed Intel Labs’ software compliance ecosystem**, cutting release timelines from weeks to *hours* and creating the **Intel Labs Compliance Portal**, a company-wide knowledge hub for security and open-source best practices.  
- **Pioneered Responsible AI and open-source model governance**, enabling Intel’s first multimodal AI model release (**LAVA**, derived from Meta’s Llama 3) through alignment across Legal, Research, and Executive stakeholders.  
- **Modernized enterprise development practices** by leading GitHub migration onboarding, developer training, and process integration for hundreds of repositories across global research teams.  
- **Re-architected the Adaptive Contextual Aware Toolkit (ACAT)** accessibility suite, boosting test coverage from 0 % → 85 % and delivering the first new feature release in two years.  
- **Strengthened Intel’s security posture** through code audits, secure compiler and coding standards, cross-geo coordination, and development of a reusable SDL testing framework.  
- **Delivered security training and mentorship**, including *Introduction to Security Principles and Cryptography* and hands-on fuzzing projects with university interns.  
- **Collaborated with the U.S. Air Force Academy’s Center of Innovation** on secure collaboration software using Intel SGX—co-presenting findings to faculty and DHS representatives.  
- **Resolved critical vulnerabilities** in collaboration with Intel PSIRT, driving patches and institutionalizing secure coding practices across teams.  

### Core Strengths

- Translating policy and compliance frameworks into **developer-friendly tools and processes**  
- Building **secure, cross-platform, and high-performance systems** under demanding research conditions  
- Leading modernization efforts that **merge legacy systems with contemporary engineering practices**  
- Acting as a **liaison between technical and executive stakeholders**, ensuring alignment and execution  
- Mentoring teams and fostering a **culture of practical innovation** that outlasts any single project
