## **Product Security & Research Operations Achievements**

**Intel Labs — Product Security Expert (PSE)**  
*2019 – Present*

- **Streamlined compliance workflows** by identifying redundant steps in Intel’s SWLC and SDL release processes, reducing software release times from weeks or months to *days or even hours*, enabling researchers to focus on innovation rather than bureaucracy.  
- **Created the Intel Labs Compliance Portal**, a one-stop internal site consolidating guidance, documentation, and process tools across multiple wikis and systems—now a primary reference across Intel business units for compliance and open-source release best practices.  
- **Led GitHub migration enablement** for Intel Labs researchers: simplified onboarding, developed and delivered hands-on training, and provided direct support to ensure uninterrupted productivity during the company-wide SCM transition.  
- **Bridged legal and research functions** by interpreting Responsible AI and OneAI assessment requirements for applied research contexts; accelerated review cycles by initiating direct cross-team communication and clarifying policy intent with Intel Legal.  
- **Established precedent for releasing re-trained AI models** by driving legal and executive alignment on the Llama 3–derived “LAVA” model—enabling Intel Labs’ first open release of a large multimodal model and defining a repeatable compliance path for future releases.  
- **Served as trusted advisor to Intel Legal and the Responsible AI Council**, contributing feedback on policy revisions and new tool rollouts from a “boots-on-the-ground” researcher perspective to ensure practical adoption and risk alignment.  
- **Enhanced the Adaptive Contextual Aware Toolkit (ACAT)** project in collaboration with the ISR Lab: re-architected critical components for maintainability, increased automated test coverage from 0% to 85%, and guided a major core refactor enabling the first new feature release in 2 years.  
- **Resolved a critical external security vulnerability** reported to Intel PSIRT by performing deep code analysis, coordinating patch development with researchers, and strengthening secure coding practices within the team.  
- **Acted as interim technical lead** following a key developer departure, stabilizing the codebase and ensuring a successful final public release—positioning ACAT for sustainable external maintenance and continued impact in the assistive-technology community.
