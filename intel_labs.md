**Intel Labs — Senior Technical & Program Lead (Product Security, Research Operations)**  
*2019 – Present*

- **Drove organization-wide efficiency** by redesigning complex software compliance and release workflows, cutting delivery timelines from weeks to *hours* and freeing researchers to focus on innovation rather than process friction.  
- **Built and launched a centralized compliance knowledge hub**, integrating policy, tooling, and guidance from across Intel’s fragmented systems—establishing a single source of truth now referenced across multiple business units.  
- **Championed modernization initiatives** such as Intel’s enterprise GitHub migration: delivered onboarding and live training, simplified the developer experience, and ensured continuity across hundreds of repositories and research teams.  
- **Enabled Responsible AI governance at scale** by translating legal and policy frameworks into actionable guidance for research teams; streamlined assessment cycles and reduced bottlenecks through proactive cross-functional engagement.  
- **Set new precedent for open-source AI model releases**, negotiating alignment between Legal, Executive, and Research stakeholders to enable Intel’s first public release of a multimodal AI model (LAVA, derived from Meta’s Llama 3).  
- **Served as a bridge between technical and executive domains**, regularly advising Legal, Ethics, and Research leadership on emerging technology impacts, practical risk assessment, and policy implementation across AI and open-source ecosystems.  
- **Transformed the Adaptive Contextual Aware Toolkit (ACAT)** assistive-technology project: re-architected fragile legacy components, raised unit-test coverage from 0% to 85%, and led the team through its first feature release in two years.  
- **Provided crisis leadership during personnel turnover**, stepping in as acting technical lead to stabilize development, mentor junior engineers, and guide final product releases supporting accessibility research and disability advocacy.  
- **Promoted a culture of practical innovation**, consistently turning high-friction operational or compliance challenges into sustainable, automated, and researcher-friendly solutions adopted across Intel Labs.
